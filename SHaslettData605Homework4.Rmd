## Problem Set 1

#### In this problem, we'll verify using R that SVD and Eigenvalues are related as worked out in the weekly module. Given a 3 X 2 matrix A, write code in R to compute $X = AA^T$ and $Y = A^TA$. Then, compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of X and Y using the built-in commands in R. Then, compute the left-singular, singular values, and right-singular vectors of A using
the svd command.

**A. _Compute $X = AA^T$ and $Y = A^TA$._**

```{r Set-1}
# Define matrix A.
A <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, -1, 0, 4), 2, 3)

# Calculate X and Y.
X <- A %*% t(A)
Y <- t(A) %*% A

# Compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of X and Y.
eigens_x <- eigen(X)
eigens_y <- eigen(Y)

#
