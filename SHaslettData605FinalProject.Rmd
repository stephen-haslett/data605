#### Problem 1

Using R, generate a random variable $X$ that has 10,000 random uniform numbers from $1$ to $N$, where $N$ can be any number of your choosing greater than or equal to $6$. Then generate a random variable $Y$ that has $10,000$ random normal numbers with a mean of $\mu =\sigma=(N+1)/2$.  

```{r, randomVariableX}
set.seed(100)

# Set N to any number greater than or equal to 6 (in this case, 8).
N <- 8

# Generate a random variable X that has 10,000 random uniform numbers from 1 to N.
X <- runif(10000, 1, N)

# Generate a random variable Y that has 10,000 random normal numbers with the requested mean.
Y <- rnorm(10000, mean = (N+1)/2, (N+1)/2)
```
