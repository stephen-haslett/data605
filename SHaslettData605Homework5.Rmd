#### Choose independently two numbers B and C at random from the interval [0, 1] with uniform density. Prove that B and C are proper probability distributions. Note that the point (B,C) is then chosen at random in the unit square.

The first step to solving this problem is to define **B** and **C**. To do this, we can use R's
[runif()](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.6.2/topics/Uniform) function. The **_runif()_** function takes 3 arguments:
**_n_** (_the number of observations we wish to make_), **_min_** (_the lower limit of the distribution_), and finally **_max_**, (_the upper limit of the distribution_).
These arguments combined make this function is a good fit for defining the numbers **B** and **C** as per the assignment instructions.

```{r DefineNumbers}
# Randomly define numbers B and C from the interval [0, 1], with 100 observations.
B <- runif(100, 0, 1)
C <- runif(100, 0, 1)
```
