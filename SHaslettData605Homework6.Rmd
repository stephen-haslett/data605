**1. A box contains 54 red marbles, 9 white marbles, and 75 blue marbles. If a marble is randomly selected from the box,**
**what is the probability that it is red or blue? Express your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four**
**decimal places.**

The first step to soving the problem us to find out how many marbles we have in total.

```{r AnswerOnePartA}
# We have 54 red marbles, 9 white marbles, and 75 blue marbles.
red_marbles <- 54
white_marbles <- 9
blue_marbles <- 75

# Find the sum of all marbles.
total_marbles <- red_marbles + white_marbles + blue_marbles
total_marbles
```

Now that we know we have a total of **138** marbles, what is the probability that the marble we pick from the box is red?
Similarly, what is the probability that the marble we pick from the box is blue?

- There are **54 red marbles**, so the probability of picking a red marble from the box is: $\frac{54}{138}$

- There are **75 blue marbles**, so the probability of picking a blue marble from the box is: $\frac{75}{138}$

So what is the probability that the marble we pick is either red or blue?

```{r AnswerOnePartB}
# To find the probability of picking either a red or blue marble,
# we need to sum their individual probabilities.
probability_red_or_blue <- round((54 + 75) / total_marbles, 4)
probability_red_or_blue
```

**Answer:** The probability of picking either a red or blue marble is **0.9348**.


**2. You are going to play mini golf. A ball machine that contains 19 green golf balls, 20 red golf balls, 24 blue golf balls, and**
**17 yellow golf balls, randomly gives you your ball. What is the probability that you end up with a red golf ball? Express**
**your answer as a simplified fraction or a decimal rounded to four decimal places.**

```{r AnswerTwoPartA}
# First sum the total number of golf balls.
total_number_of_golf_balls <- 19 + 20 + 24 + 17
total_number_of_golf_balls
```

We have a total of **80 golf balls**, and **20 red golf balls**, so what is the probability that we end up with a red golf ball?

```{r AnswerTwoPartB}
# We have 20 red balls, therefore the probability is as follows:
round(20 / total_number_of_golf_balls, 4)
```

**Answer:** The probability that we end up with a red golf ball is **0.25**.


**3. A pizza delivery company classifies its customers by gender and location of residence. The research department has**
**gathered data from a random sample of 1399 customers. The data is summarized in the table below.**

![](/Users/stephenhaslett/Data605/gender_table.png)

**What is the probability that a customer is not male or does not live with parents? Write your answer as a fraction or a**
**decimal number rounded to four decimal places.**

```{r AnswerThree}
# Find out how many people there are in total.
total_people <- sum(81, 116, 215, 130, 129, 228, 79, 252, 97, 72)

# Remove males living with their parents from the total number of people.
total_people_less_males_living_with_parents <- total_people - 215

# To find the probability that a customer is not male or does not live with their parents, we divide
# the total number of people minus males living with their parents by the total number of people.
probability <- round(total_people_less_males_living_with_parents / total_people, 4)
probability
```

**Answer:** The probability that a customer is not male or does not live with their parents is **0.8463**.


**4. Determine if the following events are independent: Going to the gym. Losing weight.**

**Answer:** I would say that these are dependent events as going to the gym often results in losing weight.


**5. A veggie wrap at City Subs is composed of 3 different vegetables and 3 different condiments wrapped up in a tortilla.**
**If there are 8 vegetables, 7 condiments, and 3 types of tortilla available, how many different veggie wraps can be made?**

```{r AnswerFive}
# We can use R's choose() function to solve this problem. The choose() function calculates
# the number of sets with x elements that can be chosen from a set with k.
vegetables <- choose(8, 3)
condiments <- choose(7, 3)
tortilla <- choose(3, 1)

# Multiply the results to find the total number of possible combinations.
total_number_of_combinations <- vegetables * condiments * tortilla
total_number_of_combinations
```

**Answer:** **5880** different veggie wraps can be made.


**6. Determine if the following events are independent. Jeff runs out of gas on the way to work. Liz watches the evening news.**

**Answer:** These are independent events as Jeff running out of gas on the way to work has no relation to Liz watching the evening news.


**7. The newly elected president needs to decide the remaining 8 spots available in the cabinet he/she is appointing.**
**If there are 14 eligible candidates for these positions (where rank matters), how many different ways can the members**
**of the cabinet be appointed?**

```{r AnswerSeven}
appointment_possibilities <- choose(14, 8) * factorial(8)
appointment_possibilities
```

**Answer:** There are **121080960**  different ways the members of the cabinet can be appointed.


**8. A bag contains 9 red, 4 orange, and 9 green jellybeans. What is the probability of reaching into the bag and randomly**
**withdrawing 4 jellybeans such that the number of red ones is 0, the number of orange ones is 1, and the number of green**
**ones is 3? Write your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four decimal places.**

```{r AnswerEight}
# Define the jellybeans.
red <- 9
orange <- 4
green <- 9

# Calculate the total number of combinations related to withdrawing 4 jellybeans.
total_jellybeans <- sum(red, orange, green)
total_combinations <- choose(total_jellybeans, 4)

# Calculate the possible combinations of withdrawing each jellybean.
red_choice <- choose(red, 0)
orange_choice <- choose(orange, 1)
green_choice <- choose(green, 3)

# Calculate the probability.
probability <- round((red_choice * orange_choice * green_choice) / total_combinations, 4)
probability
```

**Answer:** The probability of reaching into the bag and randomly withdrawing 4 jellybeans such that the number of red ones is 0,
the number of orange ones is 1, and the number of green ones is 3, is **0.0459**.


**9. Evaluate the following expression: $\frac{11!}{7!}$**

```{r AnswerNine}
answer <- factorial(11) / factorial(7)
answer
```

**Answer:** 7920


**10. Describe the complement of the given event - 67% of subscribers to a fitness magazine are over the age of 34.**

**Answer:** The complement of this event is that 33% of subscribers to a fitness magazine are under the age of 34.


**11. If you throw exactly three heads in four tosses of a coin you win $97. If not, you pay me $30.**

**Step 1. Find the expected value of the proposition. Round your answer to two decimal places.**

```{r ElevenStepOne}
probability_of_winning <- pbinom(3, 4, 0.5) - pbinom(2, 4, 0.5)
probability_of_losing <- 1 - probability_of_winning
expected_value <- round((97 * probability_of_winning) - (30 * probability_of_losing), 4)
expected_value
```

**Answer:** The expected value of the proposition is **1.75**.


**Step 2. If you played this game 559 times how much would you expect to win or lose? (Losses must be entered as negative.)**

```{r ElevenStepTwo}
559 * 1.75
```

**Answer:** If I played this game 559 times I would expect to win **$978.25**.


**12. Flip a coin 9 times. If you get 4 tails or less, I will pay you $23. Otherwise you pay me $26.**

**Step 1. Find the expected value of the proposition. Round your answer to two decimal places.**

```{r TwelveStepOne}
probability_of_winning <- pbinom(4, 9, 0.5)
probability_of_losing <- 1 - probability_of_winning
expected_value <- round((23 * probability_of_winning) - (26 * probability_of_losing), 4)
expected_value
```

**Answer:** The expected value of the proposition is **-1.5**.


**Step 2. If you played this game 994 times how much would you expect to win or lose? (Losses must be entered as negative.)**

```{r TwelveStepTwo}
994 * -1.5
```

**Answer:** If I played this game 994 times I would expect to lose **$1491.00**.


**13. The sensitivity and specificity of the polygraph has been a subject of study and debate for years. A 2001 study of the**
**use of polygraph for screening purposes suggested that the probability of detecting a liar was .59 (sensitivity) and that**
**the probability of detecting a "truth teller" was .90 (specificity). We estimate that about 20% of individuals selected for**
**the screening polygraph will lie.**

```{r Thirteen}
# Probability of detecting a liar (sensitivity).
probability_detecting_liar <- 0.59
# Probability of not detecting a liar.
probability_not_detecting_liar <- 1 - probability_detecting_liar
# Probability of detecting a truth teller (specificity).
probability_detecting_truth_teller <- 0.90
# Probability of not detecting a truth teller.
probability_not_detecting_truth_teller <- 1 - probability_detecting_truth_teller
# Probability that the test subject is a liar.
probability_liar <- 0.2
# Probability that the test subject is a truth teller.
probability_truth_teller <- 1 - probability_liar
```

**a. What is the probability that an individual is actually a liar given that the polygraph detected him/her as such? (Show**
**me the table or the formulaic solution or both.)**

```{r ThirteenStepOne}
actual_liar <- round((probability_liar * probability_detecting_liar) /
                     ((probability_liar * probability_detecting_liar) +
                     (probability_truth_teller * probability_not_detecting_truth_teller)), 4)
actual_liar
```

**Answer:** The probability that an individual is actually a liar given that the polygraph detected him/her as such is **0.596**.


**b. What is the probability that an individual is actually a truth-teller given that the polygraph detected him/her as**
**such? (Show me the table or the formulaic solution or both.)**

```{r ThirteenStepTwo}
truth_teller <- round((probability_truth_teller * probability_detecting_truth_teller) /
                      ((probability_truth_teller * probability_detecting_truth_teller) +
                      (probability_liar * probability_not_detecting_liar)), 4)
truth_teller
```

**Answer:** The probability that an individual is actually a truth-teller given that the polygraph detected him/her as such is **0.8978**.


**c. What is the probability that a randomly selected individual is either a liar or was identified as a liar by the**
**polygraph? Be sure to write the probability statement.**

**$P(LiarOrIdentifiedAsLiar) = P(liar) + (P(liar) * (1 - P(sensitivity))) = 0.2 + (0.2 * (1 - 0.59))$**

```{r ThirteenStepThree}
liar_or_identified_as_liar <- round(probability_liar + (probability_liar * (1 - probability_detecting_liar)), 2)
liar_or_identified_as_liar
```

**Answer:** The probability that a randomly selected individual is either a liar or was identified as a liar by the polygraph is **0.28**.
