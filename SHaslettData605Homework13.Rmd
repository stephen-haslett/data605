#### Problem 1:

Use integration by substitution to solve the integral below:

$\int 4e^{-7x}dx$


##### Solution 1:

Let $u = -7x$

$du = -7 dx$

$dx = \frac{du}{-7}$

$\frac{4}{-7}\int e^u du$

$\frac{-4}{7}e^{-7x} + C$

\ 

#### Problem 2:

Biologists are treating a pond contaminated with bacteria. The level of contamination is changing at a rate of $\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t} = -\frac{3150}{t^4} - 220$ bacteria per cubic centimeter per day, where $t$ is the number of days since treatment began. Find a function $N(t)$ to estimate the level of contamination if the level after day 1 was 6530 per cubic centimeter.


##### Solution 2:


$\frac{\text{d}N}{\text{d}t} = -\frac{3150}{t^4} - 220 \ \to \ \text{d}N = (-\frac{3150}{t^4}-220)\text{d}t$

Find $N$

$N = \int (-\frac{3150}{t^4}-220)\text{d}t \ \ = \int -3150(t^{-4}) \text{d}t - \int 220\text{d}t$


Apply the power rule:

$N = \frac{-3150}{-3}(t^{-3}) - 220t + C$.

\ 

Solve for $N(1) = 6530$:

$N(1) \frac{-3150}{-3}(1^{-3}) - 220(1) + C = 6530$

$C = 6530 - 1050 + 220 = 5700$.

$N(t) = -1050(t^{-3}) - 200(t) + 5700$.

#### Problem 3:

Find the total area of the red rectangles in the figure below, where the equation of the lines is $f(x) = 2x - 9$.

##### Solution 3:

$A = \int_{4.5}^{8.5}(2x - 9)dx$

**Total Area = 16**

\ 

#### Problem 4:

Find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations.

$y = x^2 -2x -2, \ \ \ y = x + 2$


##### Solution 4:

```{r, solution4}
curve(x^2 - 2*x - 2, -1, 4, col = 'purple')
curve(x + 2, add = TRUE, -1, 4, col = 'red')
```


The intersect points (boundaries) in the above graph are (-1, 1) and (4, 6). The equation to find the area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations is as follows:

\[
A = \int_{-1}^{4} x + 2 \ dx  \ - \ \int_{-1}^{4}x^2 - 2x - 2 dx \\
A = \Big[\frac{1}{2}x^2 + 2x\Big]_{-1}^{4} - \Big[\frac{1}{3}x^3 - x^2 - 2x\Big]_{-1}^{4} \\
A = -\frac{1}{3}x^3 + \frac{3}{2}x^2 + 4x\Big|_{-1}^{4} \\
\]

Using R, we now perform the calculation to find the area. 

```{r, solution4Area}
area <- ((-1/3)*(4^3) + (3/2)*(4^2) + 4*4) - ((-1/3)*((-1)^3) + (3/2)*((-1)^2) + 4*-1)
area
```

**Answer:** The area of the region bounded by the graphs of the given equations is approximately **20.83**.

#### Problem 5:

A beauty supply store expects to sell 110 flat irons during the next year. It costs $3.75 to store one flat iron for one year.
There is a fixed cost of $8.25 for each order. Find the lot size and the number of orders per year that will minimize
inventory costs.


##### Solution 5:

$Orders(x) * LotSize(n) = 110$

Let $C = cost$


$C = 8.25x + 3.75 * \frac{110/x}{2}$

$C = 8.25x + 3.75 * \frac{55}{x}$

$C = 8.25x + \frac{206.25}{x}$


Minimize costs by setting the derivative to zero.


$C' = 8.25 - \frac{206.25}{x^2}$

$0 = 8.25 - \frac{206.25}{x^2}$

$\frac{206.25}{x^2} = 8.25$

$206.25 = 8.25x^2$

$\frac{206.25}{8.25} = x^2$

$25 = x^2$


**Answer:** To minimize inventory costs, the store should make **5** orders of **22** irons per year.
