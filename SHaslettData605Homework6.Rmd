**1. A box contains 54 red marbles, 9 white marbles, and 75 blue marbles. If a marble is randomly selected from the box,**
**what is the probability that it is red or blue? Express your answer as a fraction or a decimal number rounded to four**
**decimal places.**

The first step to soving the problem us to find out how many marbles we have in total.

```{r AnswerOnePartA}
# We have 54 red marbles, 9 white marbles, and 75 blue marbles.
red_marbles <- 54
white_marbles <- 9
blue_marbles <- 75

# Find the sum of all marbles.
total_marbles <- red_marbles + white_marbles + blue_marbles
total_marbles
```

Now that we know we have a total of **138** marbles, what is the probability that the marble we pick from the box is red?
Similarly, what is the probability that the marble we pick from the box is blue?

- There are **54 red marbles**, so the probability of picking a red marble from the box is: $\frac{54}{138}$

- There are **75 blue marbles**, so the probability of picking a blue marble from the box is: $\frac{75}{138}$

So what is the probability that the marble we pick is either red or blue?

```{r AnswerOnePartB}
# To find the probability of picking either a red or blue marble,
# we need to sum their individual probabilities.
probability_red_or_blue <- round((54 + 75) / total_marbles, 4)
probability_red_or_blue
```

**Answer:** The probability of picking either a red or blue marble is **0.9348**.

**2. You are going to play mini golf. A ball machine that contains 19 green golf balls, 20 red golf balls, 24 blue golf balls, and**
**17 yellow golf balls, randomly gives you your ball. What is the probability that you end up with a red golf ball? Express**
**your answer as a simplified fraction or a decimal rounded to four decimal places.**

```{r AnswerTwoPartA}
# First sum the total number of golf balls.
total_number_of_golf_balls <- 19 + 20 + 24 + 17
total_number_of_golf_balls
```

We have a total of **80 golf balls**, and **20 red golf balls**, so what is the probability that we end up with a red golf ball?

```{r AnswerTwoPartB}
# We have 20 red balls, therefore the probability is as follows:
round(20 / total_number_of_golf_balls, 4)
```

**Answer:** The probability that we end up with a red golf ball is **0.25**.

**3. A pizza delivery company classifies its customers by gender and location of residence. The research department has**
**gathered data from a random sample of 1399 customers. The data is summarized in the table below.**

**What is the probability that a customer is not male or does not live with parents? Write your answer as a fraction or a**
**decimal number rounded to four decimal places.**

```{r AnswerThree}
