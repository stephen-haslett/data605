### Exercise 3
Let $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ be independent random variables with common distribution:

![](/Users/stephenhaslett/Data605/problem.png)

Find the distribution of the sum $x_{1} + x_{2}$.

**Answer**

```{r exercise3Solution}
# Let X be equal to X1 + X2
paste('Let X be equal to X1 + X2')

# P(X = 0)
zero <- 1/8 * 1/8
paste('P(X = 0) =', zero)

# P(X = 1)
one <- (1/8 * 3/8) + (3/8 * 1/8)
paste('P(X = 1) =', one)

# P(X = 2)
two <- (1/8 * 1/2) + (3/8 * 3/8) + (1/2 * 1/8)
paste('P(X = 2) =', two)

# P(X = 3)
three <- (3/8 * 1/2) + (1/2 * 3/8)
paste('P(X = 3) =', three)

# P(X = 4)
four <- 1/2 * 1/2
paste('P(X = 4) =', four)

# Make sure the sum of all probabilities is equal to 1.
sum <- zero + one + two + three + four
paste('Sum of all probabilities =', sum)
```
