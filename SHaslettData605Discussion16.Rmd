#### _Pick any exercise in Chapter 12 of the calculus textbook_.

##### Question 11

**_Find $fx, fy, fxx, fyy, fxy$ and $fyx$ when $f(x, y) =\frac{x}{y}$_**

**A. $\\[.1in]$**
$fx = \frac{1}{y}$

**B. $\\[.1in]$**
$fy = \frac{-x}{y^2}$

**C. $\\[.1in]$**
$fxx = 0$

**D. $\\[.1in]$**
$fyy = \frac{-2^x}{y^3}$

**E. $\\[.1in]$**
$fxy = \frac{-1}{y^2}$

**F. $\\[.1in]$**
$fyx = \frac{-1}{y^2}$

#### _What were the most valuable elements you took away from this course_?

Coming from a non mathmatical background, this course has given me a solid foundation on which to further research the concepts covered in the class and apply them to software engineering.
In particular, I found the probability and linear regression sections of the course interesting as these concepts are valuable when it comes to writing predictive software applications; something that greatly interests me.
