### Exercise 7
Discussion 10 Find the matrices $P^2, P^3, P^4$, and $P^n$ for the Markov chain determined by the transition matrix $P = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 0\ \\0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$. Do the same for the transition matrix $P =  \begin{pmatrix}0 & 1\ \\1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Interpret what happens in each of these processes.
