#### Exercise 11 - Page 303
A company buys 100 lightbulbs, each of which has an exponential lifetime of 1000 hours. What is the expected time for the first of these bulbs to burn out?

#### Exercise 14 - Page 303
Assume that  $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are independent random variables, each having an exponential density with parameter $\lambda$. Show that $Z = x_{1} − x_{2}$ has density:
$$f_{Z} = (1/2)\lambda_{e}^-\lambda|z|$$.

#### Exercise 1 - Pages 320 - 321
Let $X$ be a continuous random variable with mean $µ = 10$ and variance $σ^2 = 100/3$. Using Chebyshev’s Inequality, find an upper bound for the following probabilities.

(a) $P(|X − 10| ≥ 2)$.
(b) $P(|X − 10| ≥ 5)$.
(c) $P(|X − 10| ≥ 9)$.
(d) $P(|X − 10| ≥ 20)$.
