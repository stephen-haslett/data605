### Exercise C16 problem
![](/Users/stephenhaslett/Data605/ExerciseC16Page286.png)


### Exercise C16 solution
To solve this problem, I will utilize the **_rref()_** (_Reduced Row Echelon Form_) function provided by R's **pracma**
(_Practical Numerical Math Functions_) package - https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pracma/versions/1.9.9/topics/rref.

```{r c16solution}
# Create matrices for 'b' and 'W' so we can solve the problem in R.
matrix_b <- matrix(c(1, 1, 0, 1), 4, 1)
matrix_w <- matrix(c(1, 2, -1, 1, 1, 0, 3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2), 4, 3)

# Combine matrices b and W so we can check for the existence of a
# linear combination of vectors equal to b in the resulting span. 
matrix_b_w_combined <- cbind(matrix_w, matrix_b)

# Transform the combined matrix to 'reduced row echelon form'. 
reduced_row_form <- rref(matrix_b_w_combined)

# Output the result.
reduced_row_form
```

In order for _b_ to be considered an element of _W (in the subspace W)_, There must be a linear combination of vectors in the combined span _Wb_ equal to _b_.

'b' consists of the values 1, 1, 0, 1. In the "_reduced_row_form_" span above, the diagonal line cutting through the span consists of the
values 1, 1, 1, 0 which is a linear combination of vectors equal to b, and therefore we can say that "**_b is in the subspace W_**".

**Answer:** _b is in the subspace W_.
